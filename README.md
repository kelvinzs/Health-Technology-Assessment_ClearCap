# Health-Technology-Assessment_ClearCap
A Health Technology Assessment was conducted on the following ClearCap/Clearstix technology inorder to determine it appropriateness and suitablitity for widespread adoption in Canada with special consideration given to the Pandemic

# Summary:
In conclusion this technology is appropriate for combating and reducing the spread of
Coronavirus which I believe should make it eligible for a health technology assessment.
Healthcare systems in Canada within the province of Ontario specifically are on the brink of
collapse due to increased demand for patient care and increased complications arising from this
virus. The province is also dealing with equipment and personnel shortages such as, PPE
shortages and respiratory therapists to say the least. This technology has the potential to reduce
infection/reinfection rates significantly, reducing burden on the health system in Ontario while
saving lives through prevention.
